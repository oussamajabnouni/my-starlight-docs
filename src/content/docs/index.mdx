## The SANAD Vision

**SANAD** (Ø³Ù†Ø¯) - meaning "support" in Arabic - is building the AI infrastructure for legal professionals in MENA. We're starting where the need is greatest: helping lawyers in Tunisia and Saudi Arabia save 70% of their time on routine tasks while ensuring compliance with local laws.

### Why Now?

1. **Tunisia's Digital Leap**: 1,018 startups launched under the Startup Act, creating demand for legal services
2. **Saudi Vision 2030**: $7 trillion transformation requiring modern legal infrastructure
3. **AI Breakthrough**: GPT-4 level models now understand Arabic legal contexts
4. **Market Gap**: No local solution addresses MENA-specific legal requirements

### Your North Star Metrics

- **Month 1**: 3 pilot law firms in Tunis
- **Month 3**: 10 paying customers, $5K MRR
- **Month 6**: 50 law firms, expansion to Saudi Arabia
- **Year 1**: $500K ARR, Series A ready
