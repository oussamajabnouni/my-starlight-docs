Hi [Name],

I saw your investment in [Portfolio Company] and your thesis on MENA digitalization. 

We're building SANAD, the first AI platform that actually understands Arabic legal documents. We already have 3 paying law firms in Tunisia and an LOI from the bar association.

The opportunity:

We're raising $250K to launch commercially. [Famous Angel] has already committed $50K.

**"What's your moat?"**
> "1) Largest Arabic legal training dataset, 2) Bar association partnerships, 3) Trust from local presence, 4) Network effects as firms share anonymized insights."

**"Why not start in a bigger market?"**
> "Tunisia is perfect for iteration - small enough to dominate, sophisticated enough to matter. Saudi expansion starts month 9."

**"How do you handle data privacy?"**
