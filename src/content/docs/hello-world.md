# Hello World!

Welcome to my Astro Starlight documentation site. This is my first markdown page.

## What is Astro Starlight?

Astro Starlight is a full-featured documentation theme built on top of the Astro framework. It provides:

- 📝 **Markdown-based content** - Write your docs in simple Markdown
- 🎨 **Beautiful design** - Clean, responsive layout out of the box
- 🌍 **i18n ready** - Full internationalization support
- 🔍 **Search built-in** - Find anything in your docs quickly
- 🌙 **Dark mode** - Automatic light/dark theme switching

## Getting Started

To edit this page, simply modify the file at:

```
src/content/docs/hello-world.md
```

All changes will be reflected when you run `npm run dev` (after installing dependencies).

## Code Example

Here's a simple JavaScript example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
// Output: Hello, World!
```

## Next Steps

- Edit this file locally with your favorite markdown editor
- Add more pages in the `src/content/docs/` directory
- Customize the site configuration in `astro.config.mjs`
- Deploy to your favorite hosting platform

Happy documenting! 🚀
