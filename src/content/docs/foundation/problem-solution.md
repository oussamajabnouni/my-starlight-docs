# The Problem We're Solving

## The Lawyer's Daily Struggle

### A Day in the Life of Ahmed, Corporate Lawyer in Tunis

**7:00 AM** - Arrives early to review a 150-page acquisition agreement in French
**9:30 AM** - Still highlighting key clauses manually
**11:00 AM** - Realizes he missed a critical liability clause on page 87
**2:00 PM** - Drafting a new employment contract from scratch (again)
**4:00 PM** - Searching through emails for that precedent from 6 months ago
**7:00 PM** - Finally starts actual legal analysis
**9:00 PM** - Goes home, exhausted, knowing tomorrow will be the same

**Result**: 70% of time on routine tasks, 30% on high-value legal work

## The Core Problems

### 1. Information Overload
- **Volume**: Average M&A deal involves 5,000+ pages of documents
- **Languages**: Documents in Arabic, French, English (often mixed)
- **Formats**: PDFs, scanned documents, emails, Word files
- **Time Pressure**: 48-hour due diligence windows are common

### 2. Knowledge Management Crisis
- **No Institutional Memory**: When a lawyer leaves, their knowledge leaves
- **Precedent Chaos**: Thousands of documents, no organization
- **Version Control**: Which contract version is the latest?
- **Cross-Office Collaboration**: Tunis, Sfax, and Sousse offices work in silos

### 3. Compliance Complexity
- **Multi-Jurisdictional**: Tunisian law + French influence + Islamic finance
- **Constant Changes**: 200+ regulatory updates per year
- **Language Barriers**: Laws in Arabic, contracts in French, clients speak English
- **Risk Management**: One missed clause = potential million-dollar liability

### 4. Client Expectations vs Reality
| Client Expects | Current Reality | Gap |
|----------------|-----------------|-----|
| 24-hour contract review | 3-5 days | 4x slower |
| Fixed pricing | Hourly billing uncertainty | No predictability |
| Proactive updates | Radio silence | Poor communication |
| Digital delivery | Physical documents | Inefficient |
