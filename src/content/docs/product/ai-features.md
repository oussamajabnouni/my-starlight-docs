## Technical Implementation

### LLM + RAG Architecture
```python
class ContractAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        # LLM APIs
        self.gpt4 = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_KEY)
        self.claude = Anthropic(api_key=ANTHROPIC_KEY)
        
        # RAG components
        self.embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-large")
        self.vector_store = PineconeVectorStore(index="sanad-legal")
        self.reranker = CohereRerank()
        
        # Prompt engineering
        self.prompt_templates = LegalPromptTemplates()
    
    async def analyze_contract(self, contract_text: str, language: str):
        # 1. Retrieve relevant legal context
        legal_context = await self.retrieve_legal_context(contract_text)
        
        # 2. Construct prompt with context
        prompt = self.prompt_templates.contract_analysis(
            contract=contract_text,
            context=legal_context,
            language=language,
            instructions="""
            Extract and analyze:
            1. Key parties and obligations
            2. Financial terms and payment conditions
            3. Termination clauses
            4. Liability and indemnification
            5. Potential risks and missing clauses
            
            Provide response in structured JSON format.
            """
        )
        
        # 3. Get analysis from LLM
        analysis = await self.gpt4.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert legal analyst specializing in " + 
                 ("Tunisian civil law" if language == "fr" else "Saudi commercial law")},
                {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
            ],
            temperature=0.1,
            response_format={"type": "json_object"}
        )
        
        return json.loads(analysis.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Prompt Engineering for Legal AI
```python
class LegalPromptTemplates:
    def contract_analysis(self, contract, context, language, instructions):
        return f"""
        LEGAL CONTEXT FROM SIMILAR CONTRACTS:
        {self.format_context(context)}
        
        CONTRACT TO ANALYZE:
        {contract}
        
        ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
        {instructions}
        
        IMPORTANT:
        - Base your analysis on the provided legal context
        - Cite specific clauses when identifying issues
        - Compare against standard practices from the context
        - Flag any deviations from typical contracts
        - Ensure compliance with {language} legal requirements
        """
```

### Data Requirements
1. **Training Data Needed**:
   - 10,000+ Tunisian contracts (anonymized)
   - 5,000+ Saudi contracts (when expanding)
   - Labeled risk assessments from lawyers
   - Standard clause libraries

2. **Data Sources**:
   - Partner law firms (with NDAs)
   - Public contract databases
   - Bar association resources
   - Synthetic data generation

## Accuracy & Safety Measures

### Preventing AI Hallucinations
1. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Always cite sources
2. **Confidence Scoring**: Show certainty levels for each finding
3. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Require lawyer verification for critical issues
4. **Constrained Generation**: Limit AI to predefined analysis patterns

### Quality Assurance Framework
```python
quality_metrics = {
    "accuracy": {
        "target": 95,  # % of correctly identified terms
        "measurement": "Human expert validation"
    },
    "completeness": {
        "target": 98,  # % of contracts fully analyzed
        "measurement": "Automated testing suite"
    },
    "speed": {
        "target": 30,  # seconds per 50-page contract
        "measurement": "Performance monitoring"
    }
}
```
