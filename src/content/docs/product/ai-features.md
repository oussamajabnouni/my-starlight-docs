## Recommended Initial Service: Contract Analysis

### Why Contract Analysis Wins

1. **Market Validation**: E-Tafakna's "Elyssa AI" proves local demand
2. **Clear ROI**: Lawyers spend 5-10 hours per contract manually
3. **Manageable Scope**: Can start with specific contract types
4. **Technical Feasibility**: Well-defined task with measurable accuracy
5. **Expansion Path**: Gateway to broader document services

### Core Features for MVP

#### Phase 1: Basic Analysis (Months 1-3)
```python
# Core contract analysis features
contract_analyzer = {
    "key_terms_extraction": {
        "parties": "Identify all contracting parties",
        "dates": "Extract all relevant dates",
        "obligations": "List all party obligations",
        "payment_terms": "Financial terms and conditions"
    },
    "risk_identification": {
        "missing_clauses": "Flag absent standard clauses",
        "unusual_terms": "Highlight non-standard provisions",
        "compliance_check": "Verify local law compliance"
    },
    "summary_generation": {
        "executive_summary": "1-page overview",
        "action_items": "Required next steps",
        "red_flags": "Critical issues requiring attention"
    }
}
```

#### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Months 4-6)

## Technical Implementation

### AI Model Architecture
```python
class ContractAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        # Base models for language understanding
        self.arabic_model = "aubmindlab/bert-base-arabertv2"
        self.french_model = "camembert-base"
        self.english_model = "legal-bert-base"
        
        # Custom fine-tuned models
        self.clause_extractor = "sanad-clause-extractor-v1"
        self.risk_scorer = "sanad-risk-analyzer-v1"
        
        # RAG for precedent matching
        self.vector_db = "pinecone"
        self.embeddings = "multilingual-e5-large"
```

### Data Requirements
1. **Training Data Needed**:
   - 10,000+ Tunisian contracts (anonymized)
   - 5,000+ Saudi contracts (when expanding)
   - Labeled risk assessments from lawyers
   - Standard clause libraries

2. **Data Sources**:
   - Partner law firms (with NDAs)
   - Public contract databases
   - Bar association resources
   - Synthetic data generation

## Accuracy & Safety Measures

### Preventing AI Hallucinations
1. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Always cite sources
2. **Confidence Scoring**: Show certainty levels for each finding
3. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Require lawyer verification for critical issues
4. **Constrained Generation**: Limit AI to predefined analysis patterns

### Quality Assurance Framework
```python
quality_metrics = {
    "accuracy": {
        "target": 95,  # % of correctly identified terms
        "measurement": "Human expert validation"
    },
    "completeness": {
        "target": 98,  # % of contracts fully analyzed
        "measurement": "Automated testing suite"
    },
    "speed": {
        "target": 30,  # seconds per 50-page contract
        "measurement": "Performance monitoring"
    }
}
```
