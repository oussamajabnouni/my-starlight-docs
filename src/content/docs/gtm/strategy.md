## Sales Playbook

### The SANAD Sales Method

#### 1. Discovery (Understand Pain)
**Questions to Ask**:
- "Walk me through your contract review process"
- "How many hours did your last due diligence take?"
- "What happens when a senior lawyer is sick?"
- "How do you ensure consistency across lawyers?"

**Listen for**:
- Time pain ("I worked until 2 AM")
- Quality pain ("We missed a crucial clause")
- Knowledge pain ("Only Ahmed knows that")
- Growth pain ("We can't take more cases")

#### 2. Demo (Show Specific Value)
**Demo Flow**:
1. "Can you share a recent contract?" (use their document)
2. Upload and process live (30 seconds)
3. Show extracted terms they care about
4. Highlight a risk they missed
5. Generate summary in their format

**Key Phrases**:
- "This would have saved you..."
- "Imagine if every lawyer could..."
- "What if you never missed..."

#### 3. Trial (Prove Value)
**Trial Success Process**:
- Day 1: Onboarding call
- Day 3: Check-in, solve issues
- Day 7: Success metrics review
- Day 10: Case study call
- Day 14: Pricing discussion

#### 4. Close (Make it Easy)
**Closing Tactics**:
- "Based on X hours saved, ROI is Y"
- "Start with one team, expand later"
- "Month-to-month, cancel anytime"
- "Your competitor X is already using us"

**Objection Handling**:

*"It's too expensive"*
→ "How much do you bill per hour? This saves 10 hours/month"

*"We need to think about it"*
→ "What specific concerns can I address? Let's extend trial"

*"Our lawyers won't adopt it"*
→ "Let's start with your most tech-savvy lawyer as champion"
